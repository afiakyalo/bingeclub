The Bingeclub is a mobile friendly application where users can join different movie clubs and schedule screenings together. A club can consist of friends or random selection of users.
The clubs will be based on movie genres and location. Users can invite friends although clubs are open to anyone. They will get movie suggestions, can create a watchlist, vote on the movies to watch and track movies they have watched.
They will be able to add comments and rate the movies.
The app will make use of the OMDb API to get movie data, Omniauth for user authentication and Twilio for user invites.
